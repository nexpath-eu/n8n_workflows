# Separate Column Fix for AI Node Outputs

## Problem
The "Save Product Benefits to Excel" (Node A) and "Save Brand Benefits to Excel" (Node B) were both updating the same `workflowStep` and `timestamp` columns, causing Node B to overwrite Node A's data.

## Solution
Created separate columns for each AI node output to preserve both results independently.

## Column Mapping Changes

### Node A (Save Product Benefits to Excel)
**Before:**
- `productBenefitsStructured` ← Product benefits JSON
- `workflowStep` ← "A_ProductBenefits"  
- `timestamp` ← Timestamp

**After:**
- `productBenefitsStructured` ← Product benefits JSON
- `workflowStep_A` ← "A_ProductBenefits"
- `timestamp_A` ← Timestamp

### Node B (Save Brand Benefits to Excel)  
**Before:**
- `Customer Benefits (Brand-level)` ← Brand benefits JSON
- `workflowStep` ← "B_BrandBenefits" (overwrote Node A)
- `timestamp` ← Timestamp (overwrote Node A)

**After:**
- `Customer Benefits (Brand-level)` ← Brand benefits JSON
- `workflowStep_B` ← "B_BrandBenefits"
- `timestamp_B` ← Timestamp

## Result
✅ Node A outputs are preserved in: `productBenefitsStructured`, `workflowStep_A`, `timestamp_A`
✅ Node B outputs are preserved in: `Customer Benefits (Brand-level)`, `workflowStep_B`, `timestamp_B`
✅ Both AI node outputs can be tracked and used separately
✅ No data overwriting occurs

## Google Sheets Columns Structure
Your form response sheet will now have these separate tracking columns:

| Original Data | Node A Outputs | Node B Outputs |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Product/Service name (match key) | productBenefitsStructured | Customer Benefits (Brand-level) |
| [All form fields] | workflowStep_A | workflowStep_B |
| | timestamp_A | timestamp_B |

This allows you to:
- Track when each AI node completed
- Identify which workflow step each output belongs to  
- Use each AI node's output independently for further processing
- Maintain a complete audit trail of the workflow execution
