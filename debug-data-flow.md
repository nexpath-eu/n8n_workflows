# Debug Data Flow for BVP Generator

## Issue Analysis
The problem is likely that the "C. BVP Generator (Batched)" node is not receiving the expected data format.

## Expected Data Flow:

1. **"Split Benefits into Batches"** should output:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "json": {
         "batchNumber": 1,
         "totalBatches": 5,
         "benefits": [/* 50 benefit objects */],
         "brandContext": {/* brand info */},
         "batchSize": 50,
         "startIndex": 0,
         "endIndex": 49,
         "totalBenefits": 250
       }
     },
     // ... more batch objects
   ]
   ```

2. **"Process Each Batch"** should send ONE batch at a time:
   ```json
   {
     "batchNumber": 1,
     "totalBatches": 5,
     "benefits": [/* 50 benefit objects */],
     "brandContext": {/* brand info */},
     "batchSize": 50,
     "startIndex": 0,
     "endIndex": 49,
     "totalBenefits": 250
   }
   ```

3. **"C. BVP Generator (Batched)"** should access via expressions like:
   - `{{ $json.brandContext.brandName }}`
   - `{{ $json.batchNumber }}`
   - `{{ JSON.stringify($json.benefits, null, 2) }}`

## Debug Steps:

1. **Check "Split Benefits into Batches" output**: Look at the console logs
2. **Check "Process Each Batch" output**: Should see individual batch objects
3. **Check expressions in C node**: Make sure they match the data structure

## Quick Test:
Add this to the beginning of your C node user prompt to see what data you're getting:

```
**DEBUG - Received Data Structure:**
- Keys available: {{ Object.keys($json) }}
- Batch Number: {{ $json.batchNumber || 'NOT FOUND' }}
- Benefits Count: {{ ($json.benefits && $json.benefits.length) || 'NOT FOUND' }}
- Brand Name: {{ $json.brandContext?.brandName || 'NOT FOUND' }}
